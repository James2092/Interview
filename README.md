# Interview

## Database
I have included a CreateDatabase.sql file, that has the command for creating the database Interview, Emp schema, Employees table and stored procedure sp_AddEmployee.

## Client HTML 
There is a html file named Client.html you will need to naviagte to this in your browser.

## Web API
The web API will run locally on IISExpress you can navigate to this via http://localhost:44390, I have also hard coded this within the client.js that is used within the client.html file.

## Console Application
Within the properties of the console application project I have added an Application Argument for the data file. Feel free to change this to your own location or run the console application by supplying the argument.
